## How to use Clippit

Clippy is an virtual assistant, but you need a how-to. This is the how-to heading.

### Step 1: Install Microsoft Office

You need Microsoft Office to use Clippit, which is Office 97 to 2003. That's 100% possible for Clippit to come when you go to __Help__ > __Show the Office Assistant__.
